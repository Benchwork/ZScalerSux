ZScaler Bypasser
================
This is my extension for Chrome which allows you to save a username and password
for your Zscaler login screen to avoid losing as much time as possible.

Instalation
===========
**Chrome:**  
Install the following extension  
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zscaler-bypass/inpjnonajpfooenokaaficjpohcpikdl

**Firefox:**  
First install the GreaseMonkey addon.  
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/  
Restart Firefox and click the link below.  
https://github.com/Goodwine/ZScalerSux/raw/master/GM/bypass.user.js

*Note:* Currently supported only from FF 12+ and GM 1.5+

How to use it
=============
When the login splash for ZScaler appears, there will be a link on the right corner.
Click the link and some inputs will appear.  
Type in your account and password and click Save.  

Everything is done, from now on you won't have to type in your account and password,
they will be sent automatically so you only have to wait until your homepage pops up.

Disclaimer
==========
The account and password will be stored raw.  
It won't be sent to anyone over the internet, but you have to be careful.  
Using this means you do not care at all about your account and you only want to work
faster and to avoid the bothersome login screen.
